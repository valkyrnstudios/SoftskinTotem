# Softskin totem

Are you a tank and tired of shaman dropping Softskin Totem instead of Strength of Earth claiming it prevents so much damage? Then this addon is for you!

Inspecting party member talents is difficult in BCC, so `/sst report` will show theoretical loss of Attack Power if all members where melee specced, use `/sst announce` to show the group.

After a recent Hyjal run (01/28), which is the prime use case for Softskin Totem.

## Strength of Earth

[Rank 6](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=25527/strength-of-earth) gives 86 strength for Elemental shaman, but Enhancement and Restoration get [Enhancing Totems](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=16295/enhancing-totems) which brings it to 98 strength. In a raid environment this is amplified by [Kings](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) to a total of 108 Strength.

[Druids, Paladins, Shaman and Warriors gain 2 melee Attack Power per point of Strength](https://tbc.wowhead.com/guides/classic-the-burning-crusade-stats-overview), which means Enhanced Strength of Earth gives ~216AP to each group member without any talents of their own. Rogues only get 1 melee Attack Power per point of Strength.

## Stoneskin totem

Talents cannot easily be inspected with party members, so calculations assume [2/2 Guardian Totems](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=16293/guardian-totems).
