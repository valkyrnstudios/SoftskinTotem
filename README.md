## Strength of Earth

[Rank 6](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=25527/strength-of-earth) gives 86 strength for Elemental shaman, but Enhamcement and Restoration get [Enhancing Totems](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=16295/enhancing-totems) which brings it to 98 strength. In a raid environment this is amplified by [Kings](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) to a total of 108 Strength.

[Druids, Paladins, Shaman and Warriors gain 2 melee Attack Power per point of Strength](https://tbc.wowhead.com/guides/classic-the-burning-crusade-stats-overview), which means Enhanced Strength of Earth gives ~216AP to each group member without any talents of their own. Rogues only get 1 melee Attack Power per point of Strength.
